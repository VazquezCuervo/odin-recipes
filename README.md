# **Odin-Recipes**

This project is a small webpage showcasing different recipes. It was created as part of my learning process in web development. Hereâ€™s what I practiced and implemented:

- Created an **index.html** file with the necessary HTML boilerplate.
- Made a **`recipes`/ directory**, containing individual HTML files for each recipe.
- Each recipe file includes:
    - A **heading** with the recipe name.
    - An **image** of the dish.
    - An **unordered list** with the ingredients.
    - An **ordered list** with the preparation steps.
- Linked all the recipes in an unordered list on the **index.html** file.
